To address the issue of inaccurate distributions in practical stochastic systems, a minimax linear-quadratic control method is proposed using the Wasserstein metric. Our method aims to construct a control policy that is robust against errors in an empirical distribution of underlying uncertainty, by adopting an adversary that selects the worst-case distribution. The opponent receives a Wasserstein penalty proportional to the amount of deviation from the empirical distribution. A closed-form expression of the finite-horizon optimal policy pair is derived using a Riccati equation. The result is then extended to the infinite-horizon average cost setting by identifying conditions under which the Riccati recursion converges to the unique positive semidefinite solution to an algebraic Riccati equation. Our method is shown to possess several salient features including closed-loop stability, and an out-of-sample performance guarantee. We also discuss how to optimize the penalty parameter for enhancing the distributional robustness of our control policy. Last but not least, a theoretical connection to the classical H-infinity method is identified from the perspective of distributional robustness.
